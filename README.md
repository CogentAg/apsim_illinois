# Simulations for fields in Illinois using APSIM
Codes to run multiple APSIM simulations on Illinois-US

# Objective
This codes allow to obtain a database simulated with APSIM for 4200 fields over 30 years.
The codes start by obtianing the field information , the soils parameters and the weather files
Then it run simulations with increasing Nitrogen rates
Finally it merges the output and evaluates different N recommendation tools.

# About the code
The scripts that obtain soil data and transforms it into APSIM files is adapted from https://github.com/rmartinezferia/APssurgo
Read the 

# Data inputs
The file called codes_index.pdf provides a description of each script and a link to additional data needed to run the code
